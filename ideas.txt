States:


0: startup and initializion of sensors
Find line and start communicating with other arduino.

1: startup complete, search for box
Ultrasonic on, Following line.

2: Closing in on box
important: staying straight on the line.

3: found box, grab ball
Close arm, go back a few cm (-> 1) if failing

4: grabbed ball, turn
Hardcoded.

5: near end
Ultrasonic on, Following line.

6: Closing in on Line

7: found second box, drop ball
Simply dropping ball. Waiting.

8: finished.
Done. Standstill.

9: Something unexpected happen.
Propagate to the other and stop doing anything at all.





Ãœbertragung:
(immer) beide Richtungen: momentaner Zustand.
(immer) lichtsensoren-infos an Ultraschall
(immer) Neueste distanz vom Ultraschall
2, 6: 3 Lichtsensoren an Fahrenden
3: grabbing state of ball
7: state of dropping ball


Arduinos changing state:
transmitting each time?
